# 06 - Python Sets

This module introduces Python sets, which are unordered, mutable collections of unique items. It demonstrates various operations on sets using the `sets.py` script, aimed at beginners learning about this fundamental data structure.

## Concepts Covered

- Creating sets using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` constructor
- Finding the length of sets using `len()`
- Checking if items exist in sets using the `in` operator
- Adding single items with `add()` method
- Adding multiple items with `update()` method
- Removing items with `remove()` and `pop()` methods
- Clearing all items with `clear()` method
- Deleting entire sets with `del`
- Converting lists and other iterables to sets
- Joining sets using `union()` and `update()` methods
- Finding intersection of sets using `intersection()` method
- Checking subset and superset relationships using `issubset()` and `issuperset()` methods
- Finding differences between sets using `difference()` method

## Script Overview (`sets.py`)

The script demonstrates set operations through the following sections:

1. **Creating Sets**: Shows how to create empty and populated sets, and get their length using `len()`.
2. **Checking Items**: Demonstrates membership testing with the `in` operator to check if items exist in sets.
3. **Adding Items**: Illustrates adding single items with `add()` and multiple items with `update()`.
4. **Removing Items**: Shows how to remove specific items with `remove()` and arbitrary items with `pop()`.
5. **Clearing and Deleting Sets**: Demonstrates clearing all items with `clear()` and deleting entire sets with `del`.
6. **Converting to Sets**: Shows how to convert lists and other iterables to sets to remove duplicates.
7. **Joining Sets**: Combines sets using `union()` to create new sets and `update()` to modify existing sets.
8. **Set Intersection**: Finds common elements between sets using the `intersection()` method.
9. **Subset and Superset**: Checks if one set is a subset or superset of another using `issubset()` and `issuperset()` methods.
10. **Set Difference**: Finds elements that are in one set but not in another using the `difference()` method.

Experiment by:

- Adding duplicate items to sets and observing how they're automatically removed.
- Testing different data types in sets (integers, strings, mixed types).
- Practicing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
- Creating sets from various data sources like strings, lists, and tuples.
- Exploring subset and superset relationships between different sets.
- Using difference operations to find unique elements in sets.
