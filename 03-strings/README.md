# 03 - Python Strings

This module demonstrates how to work with strings in Python using the `strings.py` script. It is intended for beginners who want to understand string creation, manipulation, and common built-in methods.

## Concepts Covered

- Single-line strings
- Multi-line strings using triple quotes
- Printing and measuring length with `len()`
- String concatenation using `+`
- Unpacking characters into variables
- Indexing and negative indexing
- Slicing strings
- Escape sequences:
  - `\n` (newline)
  - `\t` (tab)
  - `\\` (backslash)
  - `\"` (double quote)
- Common string methods:
  - `capitalize()`
  - `count()`
  - `endswith()`
  - `find()`
  - `format()`
  - `index()`
  - `join()`
  - `strip()`
  - `replace()`
  - `split()`
  - `title()`
  - `swapcase()`
  - `startswith()`

## Script Overview (`strings.py`)

The script includes examples of:

- Declaring and printing strings
- Concatenating `first_name` and `last_name` into `full_name`
- Comparing string lengths
- Accessing individual characters by index
- Extracting substrings with slicing (including step slicing)
- Demonstrating escape sequences in formatted text
- Using multiple string methods to transform and inspect text

Each example prints output to help you see how the operations work.

## How to Run

From the repository root:

```bash
cd 03-strings
python strings.py
```

Experiment by:

- Changing the sample strings
- Trying additional methods (e.g. `upper()`, `lower()`)
- Modifying slices and observing the results
