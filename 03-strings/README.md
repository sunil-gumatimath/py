# Python Strings Script

This script, `strings.py`, demonstrates various string operations and methods in Python.

## Script Details (`strings.py`)

The script covers the following string concepts and operations:

- **Single Line Strings**: Declaring strings with single or double quotes, printing, and checking length.
- **Multiline Strings**: Using triple quotes for multiline strings.
- **String Concatenation**: Combining strings using the `+` operator.
- **Unpacking Characters**: Assigning string characters to individual variables.
- **Accessing Characters by Index**: Using positive and negative indexing to access string characters.
- **Slicing**: Extracting substrings using slice notation, including step slicing.
- **Escape Sequences**: Using escape characters like `\n`, `\t`, `\\`, `\"` for formatting.
- **String Methods**:
  - `capitalize()`: Converts the first character to uppercase.
  - `count()`: Counts occurrences of a substring.
  - `endswith()`: Checks if the string ends with a specified suffix.
  - `find()`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring.
  - `format()`: Formats strings with placeholders.
  - `index()`: Similar to find, but raises an error if not found.
  - `join()`: Joins elements of an iterable with the string as separator.
  - `strip()`: Removes leading and trailing characters.
  - `replace()`: Replaces occurrences of a substring.
  - `split()`: Splits the string into a list.
  - `title()`: Converts to title case.
  - `swapcase()`: Swaps case of all characters.
  - `startswith()`: Checks if the string starts with a specified prefix.

## How to Run

To run the script, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python strings.py
