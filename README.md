# Python Learning Repository

This repository is a collection of small Python scripts organized by topic. Each module focuses on a fundamental Python concept and is ideal for beginners who want to understand and experiment with core language features.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Basic familiarity with running commands in a terminal/command prompt

## Project Structure

- `01-variables/`
  - Declaring and using variables
  - Working with common data types: strings, integers, booleans, lists, dictionaries
  - Basic operations: string concatenation, measuring length with `len()`, accessing list elements, printing structured information
- `02-operations/`
  - Covers:
    - Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`, `**`)
    - Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
    - Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
    - Identity and membership operators (`is`, `is not`, `in`, `not in`)
  - Includes practical examples:
    - Calculating areas
    - Basic physics-style calculations
    - Boolean and expression evaluations
- `03-strings/`
  - Demonstrates:
    - Single-line and multi-line strings
    - String concatenation
    - Indexing, negative indexing, slicing
    - Unpacking characters
    - Escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, `\\`, `\"`)
    - Common string methods: `capitalize`, `count`, `endswith`, `find`, `format`, `index`, `join`, `strip`, `replace`, `split`, `title`, `swapcase`, `startswith`
- `04-lists/`
  - Demonstrates:
    - Creating lists (including typed empty lists)
    - Getting length with `len()`
    - Indexing and negative indexing
    - Slicing lists
    - Modifying items by index
    - Membership checks with `in`
    - Adding items: `append()`, `insert()`
    - Removing items: `remove()`, `pop()`, `del`
    - Clearing lists with `clear()`
    - Copying lists
    - Joining/combining lists (`+`, `extend()`)
    - Counting, indexing, reversing, and sorting

Each directory contains a dedicated `README.md` describing its script in more detail.

## Recommended Usage

- Read the module's `README.md` to understand what the script demonstrates.
- Run the script to see outputs.
- Modify values, add new examples, and re-run to reinforce understanding.

## Audience

- Beginners learning Python fundamentals
- Anyone looking for quick, focused examples of core Python concepts
