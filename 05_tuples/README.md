# 05 - Python Tuples

This module introduces Python tuples, which are ordered, immutable collections of items. It demonstrates various operations on tuples using the `tuples.py` script, aimed at beginners learning about this fundamental data structure.

## Concepts Covered

- Creating tuples using parentheses `()` or the `tuple()` constructor
- Accessing tuple elements by index (positive and negative indexing)
- Slicing tuples to extract sub-tuples
- Converting tuples to lists for modification and back to tuples
- Checking if items exist in tuples using the `in` operator
- Joining tuples using the `+` operator
- Deleting entire tuples with `del`

## Script Overview (`tuples.py`)

The script demonstrates tuple operations through the following sections:

1. **Creating Tuples**: Shows how to create empty and populated tuples, and get their length.
2. **Accessing Tuple Elements**: Demonstrates indexing from both ends of the tuple, including tuple methods like `count()` and `index()`.
3. **Slicing Tuples**: Illustrates various slicing techniques to extract portions of tuples, using both positive and negative indices.
4. **Converting Tuples to Lists**: Shows how to modify tuple contents by converting to a list, making changes, and converting back.
5. **Checking Items in Tuples**: Uses membership testing with the `in` operator and demonstrates tuple immutability by attempting (and catching) a modification error.
6. **Joining Tuples**: Combines multiple tuples into one using the `+` operator.
7. **Deleting Tuples**: Removes tuple objects entirely using `del`.

## Practice Exercises

Practice your skills with the tuple exercises in [Assignment/tuples.py](../Assignment/tuples.py):
- Creating empty tuples
- Creating tuples with siblings (brothers and sisters)
- Joining brothers and sisters tuples into siblings
- Counting siblings
- Adding parents to create family_members tuple
- Unpacking siblings and parents from family_members
- Creating separate tuples for fruits, vegetables, and animal products
- Joining multiple tuples into food_stuff_tp
- Converting tuples to lists for modification
- Slicing middle items from tuples/lists
- Slicing first three and last three items
- Deleting tuples completely
- Checking membership (e.g., 'Estonia' and 'Iceland' in nordic countries)

Experiment by:

- Modifying tuple contents and observing the immutability errors.
- Creating tuples with different data types.
- Practicing various slicing operations on existing tuples.
