# 02 - Python Operations

This module demonstrates fundamental operations in Python using the `operations.py` script. It is designed to help beginners understand how Python evaluates arithmetic expressions, comparisons, logical statements, and common numeric use cases by printing the outcome of every expression.

## Concepts Covered

- Arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`)
  - True division (`/`) and floor division (`//`)
  - Modulus (`%`) for remainders
  - Exponentiation (`**`)
- Numeric literals:
  - Integers, floats, and complex numbers
- Variable assignment and reuse to accumulate multiple results (`total`, `diff`, `product`, etc.)
- Practical calculations:
  - Area of a circle (`pi * r**2`)
  - Area of a rectangle (`length * width`)
  - Weight computation (`mass * gravity`)
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) with string-length examples
- Boolean logic (`and`, `or`, `not`) including double negation
- Identity and membership demonstrations (`is`, `is not`, `in`)

## Script Overview (`operations.py`)

The script prints sequences of worked examples in the following order:

- Literal arithmetic expressions, each immediately echoed to the console.
- Reuse of variables `a` and `b` to compute and label the results of all core arithmetic operators.
- A second block that repeats the pattern with `num_one` and `num_two`.
- Mini word problems: computing the area of a circle and rectangle, plus an object's weight.
- A collection of comparison expressions, including those based on string lengths.
- Boolean comparisons, identity tests (`1 is 1`, `4 is 2 ** 2`), and membership checks within strings.
- Logical combinations illustrating how `and`, `or`, and `not` behave with different comparisons.

## Practice Exercises

Practice your skills with the operations exercises in [Assignment/operations.py](../Assignment/operations.py):
- Variable declarations (integers, floats, complex numbers)
- User input for triangle area and perimeter calculations
- Rectangle area and perimeter with user input
- Circle area and circumference calculations using pi = 3.14
- Line equation calculations (slope and intercepts)
- Slope and Euclidean distance between two points
- Quadratic equation evaluation and root finding
- String length comparisons ('python' vs 'dragon')
- String membership checks using `and` operator
- Type conversions (int, float, string)
- Even number checking using modulus
- Type comparison exercises
- Weekly earning calculator (hours × rate per hour)
- Seconds lived calculator (years to seconds conversion)
- Number table generation (1-5 with squares and cubes)

Experiment by:

- Changing the numeric inputs to observe new outputs.
- Adding your own real-world formulas (perimeter, BMI, etc.).
- Extending the logical section with additional combinations or custom predicates.
