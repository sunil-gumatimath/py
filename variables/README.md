# Python Variables Script

This script, `variables.py`, demonstrates the declaration and usage of different data types in Python.

## Script Details (`variables.py`)

The script initializes variables of the following types:

*   **String**: `first_name`, `last_name`, `country`, `city`
*   **Integer**: `age`
*   **Boolean**: `is_married`
*   **List**: `skills` (a list of strings)
*   **Dictionary**: `person_info` (a collection of key-value pairs)

It then performs basic operations such as string concatenation and calculating the length of strings, and prints the values and results to the console.

## How to Run

To run the script, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python variables.py
```
