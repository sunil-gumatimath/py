## Learning Path

Follow this recommended order for beginners:

1. **Variables** → Start here to understand basic data storage
2. **Operations** → Learn how to manipulate and compare data
3. **Strings** → Master text processing
4. **Lists** → Work with ordered collections
5. **Tuples** → Understand immutable sequences
6. **Sets** → Explore unique collections and set theory
7. **Dictionaries** → Work with key–value mappings for structured data
8. **Conditionals** → Control program flow using `if`, `elif`, and `else`

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Read the README**: Each module has a detailed README explaining concepts
2. **Run the Scripts**: Execute the Python files to see examples in action
3. **Experiment**: Modify the code to reinforce your understanding
4. **Practice**: Try creating your own examples based on what you learn
