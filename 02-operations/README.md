# 02 - Python Operations

This module demonstrates fundamental operations in Python using the `operations.py` script. It is designed to help beginners understand how Python evaluates arithmetic expressions, comparisons, logical statements, and common numeric use cases.

## Concepts Covered

- Arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Floor division (`//`)
  - Modulus (`%`)
  - Exponentiation (`**`)
- Working with:
  - Integers
  - Floats
  - Complex numbers
- Variable assignment and reuse in expressions
- Comparison operators:
  - `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Logical operators:
  - `and`, `or`, `not`
- Identity and membership:
  - `is`, `is not`
  - `in`
- Practical examples:
  - Area of a circle
  - Area of a rectangle
  - Weight calculation using mass and gravity
- Boolean expressions and evaluation patterns

## Script Overview (`operations.py`)

The script walks through:

- Direct arithmetic printouts
- Storing results in variables (`total`, `diff`, `product`, `division`, etc.)
- Printing labeled outputs for clarity
- Several comparison and logical checks to illustrate boolean results
- Examples using:
  - `is` and `is not`
  - `in` keyword to check membership in strings
  - Combined logical expressions (`and` / `or` / `not`)

This provides a clear, step-by-step view of how Python evaluates expressions.

Experiment by:

- Changing input values
- Adding new arithmetic or boolean expressions
- Observing how different operators behave
