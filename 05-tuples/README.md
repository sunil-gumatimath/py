# 05 - Python Tuples

This module introduces Python tuples, which are ordered, immutable collections of items. It demonstrates various operations on tuples using the `tuples.py` script, aimed at beginners learning about this fundamental data structure.

## Concepts Covered

- Creating tuples using parentheses `()` or the `tuple()` constructor
- Accessing tuple elements by index (positive and negative indexing)
- Slicing tuples to extract sub-tuples
- Converting tuples to lists for modification and back to tuples
- Checking if items exist in tuples using the `in` operator
- Joining tuples using the `+` operator
- Deleting entire tuples with `del`

## Script Overview (`tuples.py`)

The script demonstrates tuple operations through the following sections:

1. **Creating Tuples**: Shows how to create empty and populated tuples, and get their length.
2. **Accessing Tuple Elements**: Demonstrates indexing from both ends of the tuple.
3. **Slicing Tuples**: Illustrates various slicing techniques to extract portions of tuples.
4. **Converting Tuples to Lists**: Shows how to modify tuple contents by converting to a list, making changes, and converting back.
5. **Checking Items in Tuples**: Uses membership testing and highlights the immutability of tuples.
6. **Joining Tuples**: Combines multiple tuples into one.
7. **Deleting Tuples**: Removes tuple objects entirely.

Experiment by:

- Modifying tuple contents and observing the immutability errors.
- Creating tuples with different data types.
- Practicing various slicing operations on existing tuples.
