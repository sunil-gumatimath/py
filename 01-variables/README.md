# 01 - Python Variables

This module introduces Python variables and core data types using the `variables.py` script. It is aimed at beginners who want to understand how to store, combine, and inspect data in Python.

## Concepts Covered

- Declaring and using variables
- Working with common data types:
  - Strings
  - Integers
  - Booleans
  - Lists
  - Dictionaries
- Basic operations:
  - String concatenation
  - Measuring string length with `len()`
  - Accessing list elements
  - Printing structured information

## Script Overview (`variables.py`)

Key examples included:

- Personal information:
  - `first_name`, `last_name`, `country`, `city`, `age`, `is_married`
- A list of skills:
  - `skills = ["java", "python", "react", "JS"]`
- A dictionary of person details:
  - `person_info = {"firstname": "Sunil", "country": "Bharat", "city": "Alamatti"}`

The script prints:

- Individual values
- Length of first and last names
- Full name and its length
- Skills and dictionary content

## How to Run

From the repository root:

```bash
cd 01-variables
python variables.py
```

Experiment by:

- Changing variable values
- Adding new variables and print statements
- Observing how Python handles different data types
